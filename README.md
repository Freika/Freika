# Hello world!

I'm Eugene, a Backend Developer working with Ruby since the beginning of 2014.

I made a number of different projects some of which even saw a light of production and served (and serving!) real users. Right now I'm interested in finances and investing (aside from developer's job) and you can reach me in [telegram](https://t.me/Freika), [twitter](https://twitter.com/itsok2befrey) or by [email](mailto:iamfrey@gmail.com).
