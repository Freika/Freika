# Hello world!

I'm Eugene, a Backend Developer working with Ruby since the beginning of 2014.

I made a number of different projects, both reached production and not. Right now I'm interested in finances and investing (aside from the developer's job). You can reach me on [telegram](https://t.me/Freika), [twitter](https://twitter.com/itsok2befrey), or by [email](mailto:iamfrey@gmail.com).
